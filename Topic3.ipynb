Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).'],\n",

If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\\n\\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\\n\\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.  Then the internal angle bisectors of the vertices intersect at four points $WXYZ$, which are the vertices of a rectangle.\\n\\n(You need the condition that $ABCD$ is not a square because if it is a square then all four angle bisectors coincide at a single point.)\\nHere are a few ways to strengthen the theorem:\\n\\n* The hypothesis \"$ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle\" can be relaxed to the more general \"$ABCD$ is a (non-rhombic) parallelogram\".  The conclusion that $WXYZ$ is a rectangle still holds.\\n* Alternatively, you can keep the original hypothesis that $ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle, and strengthen to the conclusion to say that $WXYZ$ is not just a rectangle, but a square.\\n* Having done that, you can then strengthen the conclusion of the theorem even more, by noting that the diagonal of square $WXYZ$ is equal in length to the difference of the lengths of the sides of $ABCD$.\\n* Once you know that, you can now strengthen the theorem even more by (finally) removing the hypothesis that $ABCD$ is non-square, and including the  case in which the four angle bisectors coincide at a single point as forming a \"degenerate\" square with a diagonal of length zero.\\n'\"\"\"\n",

Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).',\n",

       "  'answer_to_question': \"There is a general historical trend.\\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \\nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the “original” 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand.\",\n",

The Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system, and the exponential behavior of the wavefunction is a direct consequence of the equation. However, the exponential behavior of the wavefunction is not a simple constant, but rather a complex function that depends on the energy of the system. In this answer, we will explore the exponential behavior of the wavefunction in more detail and show how it arises from the Schrödinger equation.First, let's consider the one-electron Schrödinger equation:$$(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}))\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\epsilon\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})$$This equation describes the time evolution of a single electron in a potential field $V(\\\\mathbf{r})$. The energy of the electron is given by the parameter $\\\\epsilon$, which can be either positive or negative.To understand the exponential behavior of the wavefunction, let's assume that the potential field $V(\\\\mathbf{r})$ is slowly varying compared to the distance between the electron and the nucleus. In this case, we can approximate the Schrödinger equation as:$$(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}))\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\approx \\\\epsilon\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})$$Now, let's consider the solution of this equation. The wavefunction $\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})$ is a complex function that depends on the energy of the electron and the potential field $V(\\\\mathbf{r})$. For a given energy $\\\\epsilon$, the wavefunction can be expressed as a linear combination of basis functions:$$\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})$$Here, $N$ is the number of basis functions used to expand the wavefunction, and $c_i$ are the coefficients of the expansion. The basis functions $\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})$ are solutions of the radial part of the Schrödinger equation:$$\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{d}{dr} - \\\\frac{1}{r^2}\\\\right)\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\epsilon\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})$$These basis functions are normalized to ensure that the wavefunction is well-defined:$$\\\\int\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\phi_j(\\\\mathbf{r})d^3r = \\\\delta_{ij}$$Now, let's consider the behavior of the wavefunction at large distances from the nucleus. For a given energy $\\\\epsilon$, the wavefunction can be expressed as:$$\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\approx \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})$$As the distance between the electron and the nucleus increases, the basis functions $\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})$ decay exponentially:$$\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf{r})$$This decay is a consequence of the Schrödinger equation, which describes the time evolution of a quantum system. The exponential behavior of the wavefunction is a direct consequence of the equation, and it is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics.In conclusion, the exponential behavior of the wavefunction is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. It arises from the Schrödinger equation, which describes the time evolution of a quantum system. The wavefunction can be expressed as a linear combination of basis functions, which decay exponentially at large distances from the nucleus. This behavior is a direct consequence of the equation, and it is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics.\",\n",
       "  'answer_to_question': \"I'll answer this question from the theoretical side. The exponential behavior follows simply from the Schrödinger equation. Consider the one-electron Schrödinger equation:\\n$$\\n(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{r}))\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\epsilon\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}), \\\\epsilon < 0\\n$$\\nAt spatial points that are very far away from the nucleus, $V(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\approx 0$, so that the asymptotic solution is given by\\n$$\\n-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla^2\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\epsilon\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}), \\\\epsilon < 0\\n$$\\nThis differential equation has basic solutions of the form\\n$$\\n\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\\\sqrt{-2\\\\epsilon}\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}}\\n$$\\nfor some unit vector $\\\\mathbf{k}$. The real asymptotic behavior of $\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt{-2\\\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schrödinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\\\to +\\\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\\n$$\\n\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\\\sqrt{2I}\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}}\\n$$\\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

       "  'answer_to_question': 'DOOM itself doesn’t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for “VGA compatible” adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\\nA faster bus and/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn’t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can’t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics — for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn’t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard’s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn’t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s. The benchmark table on page 287 shows the importance of the bus.',\n",

That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\\nDebt management\\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \\nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%.

If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could.

       " {'generated_question': 'What is the content inset and when is it used?Answer:Content inset is a UI concept that defines how much content is visible in a scroll view at any given position. It is used to ensure that the content is visible even when the scroll view is scrolled to the top.Content inset is typically used in situations where the content of a scroll view is not fully visible at the top of the view. For example, in a scroll view with a transparent navigation bar or status bar, the content inset ensures that the top of the content is visible even when the scroll view is scrolled to the top.To use content inset, you need to set the content inset property of the scroll view. The content inset property specifies the distance between the top of the scroll view and the content that is visible when the scroll view is scrolled to the top.For example, to set the content inset to 100 points, you can use the following code:```scrollView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(100, 0, 0, 0);```By setting the content inset to 100 points, you ensure that the top 100 points of the content are visible when the scroll view is scrolled to the top.Content inset is also used in other situations, such as when a scroll view has a non-zero content offset at the top of the view. In this case, the content inset ensures that the content is visible even when the scroll view is scrolled to the top.In summary, content inset is a UI concept that defines how much content is visible in a scroll view at any given position.

Under the old (Linnean) classification system, Reptilia (reptiles) was an order and Aves (birds) was a separate order. Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades). It\\'s like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.\\n\\nThe clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (Stegosaurus, Triceratops, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs.\\n\\nSo all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles.

To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don\\'t mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\\n\\nA few words about pterosaurs\\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another.

This approach works well for smaller and simpler cases, but can lead to a lot of NULLs and increased storage and retrieval overhead.In class table inheritance, there are separate tables for each type of car, with a common table for all cars. When you want data about a specific type of car, you join the appropriate specialized table with the car table. This approach works better in larger and more complex cases, but requires more joins.In summary, single table inheritance is simpler and easier to implement, but can lead to storage and retrieval overhead. Class table inheritance is more complex, but can lead to faster retrieval times. The choice between the two depends on the size and complexity of the data, as well as the specific requirements of the application.',\n",

The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \\nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.

However, the dissenting opinions of Justices Thomas and Alito suggest that the President may be entitled to relief from a subpoena based on his special status as president, such as the President's duties to the nation taking up all of his time and attention.

Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\\n\\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\\n* It carries a weight of urgency — e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason — as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\\n\\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena. Instead, they are concerned that the issuance of such subpoenas might negatively impact on the President's ability to perform the duties of the office, and argue that the President might legitimately be granted varying degrees of relief from such legal actions at a court's discretion.\",\n",

The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\\n\\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976.

       "  'answer_to_question': \"Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\\n\\n* Muscle fiber density\\n* Muscle utilization\\n\\nDensity:\\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \\nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\\nUtilization:\\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \\n\\nCan a buff guy be weak? \\nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \\nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he/she doesn't train for strength per se. It seems worth noting that Olympic/power lifters also want to minimize their size (except for the heavyweights) because it affects their weight class in competition, so there is an added incentive to train for neural utilization over additional muscle mass.\",\n",

When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\\n\\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \\n\\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\\n\\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions.\",\n",

It is similar to a static method in that it is a single, shared instance of the class that can be accessed directly without creating an instance of the class.A static class is useful when you want to define a one-off, utility, or library class that doesn\\'t make sense to instantiate. For example, the Math class in Java is a static class that provides mathematical constants and calculations. It would be unnecessary and confusing to instantiate a Math class for each calculation.To use a static class in Java, you simply need to declare the class as final and make all of its members static. This means that you cannot create an instance of the class, but you can access its members directly.Here is an example of how to use a static class in Java:```import java.lang.Math;public class TestMyStaticClass {    public static void main(String []args){        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + Math.PI);        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + Math.pow(Math.PI, 2));        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error    }}// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behaviorpublic final class MyStaticClass {    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor        myStaticMember = 1;    }    private static int myStaticMember;    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {        myStaticMember = val;    }    public static int getMyStaticMember() {        return myStaticMember;    }    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;    }}```In this example, the `MyStaticClass` class is declared as final and all of its members are declared as static. This means that you cannot create an instance of the class, but you can access its members directly.Note that the `Math` class in Java is also a static class, and it is declared as final to prevent extension.In summary, a static class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and is accessed directly without creating an instance of the class. It is useful when you want to define a one-off, utility, or library class that doesn\\'t make sense to instantiate.',\n",
       "  'answer_to_question': 'Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you\\'re looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\\n\\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\\n\\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\\n     public static void main(String []args){\\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\\n        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\\n        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\\n        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error\\n     }\\n}\\n// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\\n    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor\\n        myStaticMember = 1;\\n    }\\n    private static int myStaticMember;\\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\\n        myStaticMember = val;\\n    }\\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\\n        return myStaticMember;\\n    }\\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nWhat good are static classes? A good use of a static class is in defining one-off, utility and/or library classes where instantiation would not make sense. A great example is the Math class that contains some mathematical constants such as PI and E and simply provides mathematical calculations. Requiring instantiation in such a case would be unnecessary and confusing. See the ```Math``` class and source code. Notice that it is ```final``` and all of its members are ```static```. If Java allowed top-level classes to be declared ```static``` then the Math class would indeed be static.',\n",

The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\\n\\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \\n\\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\\n\\nSupplement:\\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17.

For example, a capacitor with a high capacitance value (e.g., 1000uF) and a high voltage rating (e.g., 500V) can provide a high current pulse to a flashlamp, but the total power output will be limited by the capacitor's energy storage capacity.The discharge rate of the capacitor can also affect the maximum power output. A faster discharge rate will result in a higher current pulse, but it may also reduce the total energy storage capacity of the capacitor.In summary, the maximum power a capacitor can provide to a flashlamp depends on several factors, including the capacitance, voltage, and discharge rate of the capacitor. It is important to carefully select a capacitor with the appropriate characteristics for a specific flashlamp application.\",\n",
       "  'answer_to_question': 'The peak power at work when a flash is being discharged is extreme.\\nExample: a classic Metz 45CT (a large but still handheld unit) on full manual power delivers around 90 watt-seconds of electrical output to the flash tube in 1/300s. That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you\\'d need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \\nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal).',\n",

I\\'m sorry you\\'re experiencing this.\\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\\n\\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\\n* Be a role model. Don\\'t participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don\\'t disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn\\'t an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\\n',\n",

       " {'generated_question': ' What is the difference between convolution and correlation?Answer: Convolution and correlation are two related but distinct image processing operations. Convolution is the operation of blurring an image by sliding a filter over it, multiplying the values at each position to produce a new image. Correlation is the operation of comparing two images by finding the similarity between them.In the context of image processing, convolution is often used to blur an image, while correlation is used to compare two images for similarity. Convolution is a linear operation, meaning that it preserves the linear properties of the input image, such as the sum of the values at each position. Correlation is also a linear operation, but it is not associative, meaning that the order in which the images are compared matters.In practice, convolution is often used for image denoising, blurring, and edge detection, while correlation is used for image matching, feature extraction, and object recognition. Convolution is a more powerful tool for image processing, but it requires more computational resources and is more sensitive to noise. Correlation is faster and more robust to noise, but it is less flexible and cannot capture the same level of detail as convolution.In summary, convolution and correlation are two distinct image processing operations that serve different purposes. Convolution is a linear operation that blurs an image, while correlation is a non-associative operation that compares two images for similarity. Both operations have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the desired outcome.',\n",
       "  'answer_to_question': 'Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \\nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let\\'s say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient. But if you need to use multiple filters in succession, and you need to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time.',\n",

By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\\nLet's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three.\\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!\",\n",

       "  'answer_to_question': 'There are two somewhat orthogonal concepts in backdooring encryption algorithms:\\n\\n* The backdoor can be explicit or implicit. An explicit backdoor is one that everybody knows it is there. An implicit backdoor strives at remaining undetected by the algorithm owners. Of course, when there is an explicit backdoor, people tend to avoid the algorithm altogether, so explicit backdoors may hope to work only in the presence of a legal framework that forces implementers to use the backdoored system.\\nAn example of an explicit backdoor is the Clipper chip (which was ultimately abandoned). The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method. For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\\n* The backdoor\\'s security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that\\'s addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\\n\\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor. It is extremely difficult to have quantifiable security without making the backdoor explicit. The \"best in class\" in that area is Dual EC DRBG, and even before the Snowden business, cryptographers were already finding it weird and strongly suspected foul play (see the analyses back in 2007, 6 years before Snowden).',\n",

For example, if you want to make an element with the class ```example``` scroll into view, you can add the following CSS:```.example {  scroll-margin-top: 10px;}```This will cause the viewport to scroll to align the top border of the viewport with the top border of the element, but with 10px of additional space.If you want to make an element scroll into view using the ```scrollIntoView``` method, you can use the following code:```const el = document.querySelector(&quot;.example&quot;);el.scrollIntoView({block: &quot;start&quot;, behavior: &quot;smooth&quot;});```This will cause the viewport to scroll to align the top border of the viewport with the top border of the element.Note that if the ```html``` element has ```scroll-padding-top``` set, then that is taken into account too.Also, if you're using a framework like Vue, you might want to make sure that all changes to the DOM are finished before running ```scrollIntoView``` by using something like ```Vue.nextTick(() => el.scrollIntoView())```I hope this helps!

The reasons it is still important for ```/bin/echo``` to exist are:\\n\\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\\n\\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest/ \\\\;\\n```\\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\\\;\\n```\\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\\n```$ type -a echo\\necho is a shell builtin\\necho is /bin/echo\\n```\",\n",

This may involve visiting a local jeweler, looking at diamonds online, or even purchasing a synthetic diamond. It is important to be aware of the market prices of diamonds and to be cautious of any dealers who are trying to inflate the prices through marketing or patenting specific cuts. Additionally, it is important to consider the ethical implications of purchasing a diamond, including the environmental and social impact of diamond mining.',\n",

They still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing (particularly with the slogan \"A Diamond is Forever\") has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society.\\nThe intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect, but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds.\\nThe larger the diamond, the more likely it is to have flaws, so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 carats or greater, you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones.\\nSome other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design. This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.\\nDiamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute. In the years to come, you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers\\' prices.',\n",

The `offset` option is used to specify the starting point of the partition, and the `sizelimit` option is used to specify the maximum size of the partition.Here is an example of how you can mount the two partitions:```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\\    -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/onemount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img /mnt/img/two```Note that the first partition is probably mounted on ```/boot``` in the second partition when the system is running.You can now access the two partitions by navigating to the appropriate directory.

       "  'answer_to_question': 'There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don\\'t go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you\\'re not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don\\'t know a word, you simply can\\'t communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you\\'re trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you\\'ll start to get good enough at it that you won\\'t have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can\\'t afford long delays, you\\'ll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning. This will expand your ability to communicate in that language.',\n",

If you are concerned about your rabbit's diet, you should consult with a veterinarian or a rabbit breeder. They can provide you with personalized advice and recommendations based on your rabbit's specific needs.\",\n",
       "  'answer_to_question': \"In short, iceberg lettuce is mostly water with little to no nutrient value. A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc.\\nIf you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%.\\nMost importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium.\\nOther effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach.\\nIn addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset.\\nFinally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that\\n\\nRabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities.\\n\\nRSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths\\nBut this is disputed because\\n\\nLettuce does not contain laudanum. Edible lettuce does contain a chemical called lactucin which is a component of lactucarian. Lactucarian is the milky fluid found in some species of lettuce and occurs in much larger amounts in wild lettuce, Lactuca virosa.\\nLactucarium has sedative and analgesic effects. It creates a sense of mild euphoria. The milky exudate resembles that of opium and it can also be reduced to a thick substance which can be smoked in the same way as opium. As a result of which it acquired the name ‘lettuce opium’.\\nEdible lettuce, Lactuca sativa, does not even contain lactucarium although it does contain lactucin which is in lactucarium.\\n\\nLettuce for Rabbits and Guinea Pigs (note that rabbits and guinea pigs have different digestive systems, this link is included for the information on lettuce composition).\\nIt is not known if lactucin turns into lactucarium during the digestive process in the rabbit, there are some accounts of rabbits appearing sedated after ingesting large quantities of lettuce. Regardless of the laudanum/lactucin status, there's no reason to feed iceberg because of the low nutrient value.\\nThe House Rabbit Society's website has even more details on what foods are good for rabbits and why.\",\n",

The total number of olfactory receptor genes exceeds 1000, but the combined activity of the expressed functional receptors accounts for the number of distinct odors that can be discriminated by the human olfactory system, which is estimated to be about 10,000.

While the total tally of olfactory receptor genes exceeds 1000, more than half of them are inactive pseudogenes. The combined activity of the expressed functional receptors accounts for the number of distinct odors that can be discriminated by the human olfactory system, which is estimated to be about 10,000 (Purves, 2001).\\nDifferent receptors are sensitive to subsets of chemicals that define a “tuning curve.” Depending on the particular olfactory receptor molecules they contain, some olfactory receptor neurons exhibit marked selectivity to particular chemical stimuli, whereas others are activated by a number of different odorant molecules. In addition, olfactory receptor neurons can exhibit different thresholds for a particular odorant. How these olfactory responses encode a specific odorant is a complex issue that is unlikely to be explained at the level of the primary neurons (Purves, 2001). \\nSo in a way, the answer to your question is yes, as there are approximately 100 to 400 olfactory receptors. Just like the photoreceptors in the visual system, each sensory neuron in the olfactory epithelium in the nose expresses only a single receptor gene (Kimball).

Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. \\nLeft to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty.\\nCould he still urinate? Sure, as long as the urethra wasn't blocked.

Open terminal and type:\\n```sudo gem install cocoapods\\n```\\nGem will get installed in Ruby inside the System library. Or try on 10.11 Mac OSX El Capitan, type:\\n```sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods\\n```\\nIf there is an error &quot;activesupport requires Ruby version >= 2.xx&quot;, then install the latest active support first by typing in the terminal.\\n```sudo gem install activesupport -v 4.2.6\\n```\\n2. After installation, there will be a lot of messages, read them and if no error found, it means cocoa pod installation is done. Next, you need to set up the cocoa pod master repo. Type in terminal:\\n```pod setup\\n```\\nAnd wait it will download the master repo. The size is very big (370.0MB in Dec 2016). So it can be a while. You can track the download by opening Activity and go to the Network tab and search for git-remote-https. Alternatively, you can try adding verbose to the command like so:\\n```pod setup --verbose\\n```\\n3. Once done it will output &quot;Setup Complete&quot;, and you can create your XCode project and save it.\\n4. Then in a terminal cd to &quot;your XCode project root directory&quot; (where your .xcodeproj file resides) and type:\\n```pod init\\n```\\n5. Then open your project's podfile by typing in terminal:\\n```open -a Xcode Podfile\\n```\\n6. Your Podfile will get open in text mode. Initially, there will be some default commands in there. Here is where you add your project's dependencies. For example, in the podfile, type\\n```/****** These are Third party pods names ******/\\npod 'OpenSSL-Universal'\\npod 'IQKeyboardManager'\\npod 'FTPopOverMenu'\\npod 'TYMActivityIndicatorView'\\npod 'SCSkypeActivityIndicatorView'\\npod 'Google/SignIn'\\npod 'UPStackMenu'\\n```\\n(this is For example of adding library to your project).\\nWhen you are done editing the podfile, save it and close XCode.\\n7. Then install pods into your project by typing in terminal:\\n```pod install\\n```\\nDepending on how many libraries you added to your podfile for your project, the time to complete this varies. Once completed, there will be a message that says &quot;Pod installation complete! There are X dependencies from the Podfile and X total pods installed.&quot;\",\n",

       "  'answer_to_question': 'The answer is mostly, it is a valid guideline, but perhaps not a valid rule. It also doesn\\'t tell the whole story.\\n\\nThe point being made is that for mutable types, you cannot base the hash code on the mutable data because two equal objects must return the same hash code and the hash code has to be valid for the lifetime of the object. If the hash code changes, you end up with an object that gets lost in a hashed collection because it no longer lives in the correct hash bin.\\nFor example, object A returns hash of 1. So, it goes in bin 1 of the hash table. Then you change object A such that it returns a hash of 2. When a hash table goes looking for it, it looks in bin 2 and can\\'t find it - the object is orphaned in bin 1.  This is why the hash code must not change for the lifetime of the object, and just one reason why writing GetHashCode implementations is a pain in the butt.\\n\\nA guideline is just a guide, not a rule. In reality, ```GetHashCode``` only has to follow these guidelines when things expect the object to follow the guidelines, such as when it is being stored in a hash table. If you never intend to use your objects in hash tables (or anything else that relies on the rules of ```GetHashCode```), your implementation doesn\\'t need to follow the guidelines. When you see \"for the lifetime of the object\", you should read \"for the time the object needs to co-operate with hash tables\" or similar. Like most things, ```GetHashCode``` is about knowing when to break the rules.',\n",

       "  'answer_to_question': \"This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).\\nIn a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute &quot;bonus&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\\n\\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\\n\\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded.\",\n",

It sets a color filter on the button's background when the user touches it, and clears the filter when the user releases their touch. This creates a simple, colorful effect on the button.Solution:To create a button effect in Kotlin or Java, you can use the `setOnTouchListener` method to listen for touch events on the button. Inside the listener, you can use the `MotionEvent` object to determine the type of touch event (e.g. down, up, move) and apply the appropriate effect.In Kotlin, you can use the `buttonEffect` function to apply the effect to a button. In Java, you can use the `buttonEffect` method.For example, you can call the `buttonEffect` function on a button to apply the effect:```button.buttonEffect()```Alternatively, you can create a custom `OnTouchListener` in Kotlin or Java to handle touch events on the button and apply the effect as needed.Note: The code provided is just an example, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific needs.\",\n",

Would the First Amendment still apply?generated answer:The First Amendment applies to all speech, regardless of whether the speaker is on or off duty. The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment protects all forms of speech, including those made by government employees. In the case of a police officer, the First Amendment protects the officer's off-duty speech as well as their on-duty speech. However, the government may still have the right to discipline or fire an officer for off-duty speech that is unrelated to their official duties or that undermines the public's trust and confidence in the police department.\",\n",
       "  'answer_to_question': 'In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That’s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can\\'t necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee\\'s First Amendment rights is weighed against the government\\'s interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that\\'s not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations.',\n",
